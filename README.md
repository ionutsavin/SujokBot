# SuJokBot 🤖🌱  
A therapeutic virtual assistant built to support alternative medicine through Su Jok techniques.

## 📘 Project Overview

**SuJokBot** is a conversational AI system developed as part of my bachelor's thesis in Computer Science. The project aims to assist users in applying Su Jok therapy by providing personalized recommendations based on symptoms, using a custom-trained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system and a user-friendly mobile app interface.

The system integrates modern AI components, mobile development, and distributed architecture principles to offer a complete therapeutic experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (mobile app)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (username-based login)
- **AI Components**:
  - LangChain
  - ChromaDB (vector store)
  - HuggingFace Embeddings
  - Gemini API (LLM-based QA)
- **RAG Architecture**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for personalized symptom-based responses

## 📱 Features

- 🔍 **Symptom-based chat interface** for Su Jok therapy guidance
- 🖐️ **Interactive hand diagram** for seed placement
- 🔐 **Secure authentication** with Firebase
- 💾 **Multiple chat sessions per user**
- 📸 **Camera-based hand scanning** for capturing hand images
- 🧠 **LLM-based response generation** using Gemini + Chroma

## 🎯 Project Goals
